Used Car Information Scraper
Overview
This Python script allows users to retrieve information about used cars from the TrueCar website based on their specifications. It uses web scraping techniques to extract data such as price and mileage from the TrueCar listings page and stores the information in a MySQL database.

Dependencies
mysql.connector: A Python library for connecting to MySQL databases.
requests: Used to send HTTP requests to the TrueCar website and retrieve HTML content.
BeautifulSoup: A Python library for parsing HTML and XML documents.
re: Provides support for regular expressions, used for pattern matching.
colorama: A library for adding colored output to the console.
Usage
Input Specifications: Users are prompted to enter the specifications of the car they want to search for. Specifications should be provided without leading or trailing white spaces. For example:

mathematica
Copy code
Toyota Camry LE FWD Automatic
BMW X3 xDrive30i
AWD Honda Accord Hybrid Touring CVT
Web Scraping: The script constructs a URL based on the user input specifications and sends an HTTP request to retrieve the HTML content of the TrueCar listings page. It then uses BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and extract relevant information about used cars, such as their price and mileage.

Database Connection and Insertion: The script establishes a connection to a MySQL database (credentials need to be provided) and inserts the extracted car information into a table named truecar. Each record includes the car's name (make and model), price, and mileage.

Querying and Printing Results: After inserting the data into the database, the script executes a SQL query to retrieve all records from the truecar table. It then prints the fetched results, displaying the car's name, price, and mileage for each record.

Setup
Install the required dependencies:

Copy code
pip install mysql-connector-python requests beautifulsoup4 colorama
Ensure you have a MySQL database set up and replace the database connection details (user, password, host, database) in the script with your own.

Run the script and follow the instructions to input the car specifications.

Note
Ensure that you have appropriate permissions and authorization to scrape data from websites and store it in a database.
You can include this explanation in your README file to provide users with a clear understanding of how to use the script and what it does. Make sure to update any placeholders with actual details specific to your project.
